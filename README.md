This is MOPSO, a toolbox for multi-objective particle swarm optimization under uncertainty that leverages parallel computations on both GPU and CPU. It features objective evaluation through tNavigator and Eclipse. All code is commented to assist users in navigating the program. Users must correctly define the path to the simulator executor, data files, and variables.\
Contributions are welcome. Feel free to contact me for code fixes and debugging.
