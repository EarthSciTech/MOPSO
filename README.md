This is MOPSO, a multiobjective particle swarm optimisation under uncertainty toolbox, leveraging both GPU and CPU parallel computations, with objective evaluation throughout tNavigator and Eclipse.
All codes are commented, helping users through the program. This is important that you define the path to the simulator executor and data files and variables, correctly.
