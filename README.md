This is MOPSO, a multiobjective particle swarm optimisation under uncertainty toolbox, leveraging GPU and CPU parallel computations, with objective evaluation throughout tNavigator and Eclipse.
All codes are commented on, helping users through the program. Users must define the path to the simulator executor and data files and variables, correctly.
Contributions are welcome. Feel free to contact me for code fixes and debugging.
